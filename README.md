# Welcome to Learn 2: Why Learn is Different

Learn is designed for people who are passionate, curious, and absolutely serious about learning to code. We are on a never ending quest for knowledge and we know there are no shortcuts.

The curriculum on Learn makes no assumptions about your previous experience programming. Whether you're about to write your first line of code ever or have a computer science degree we're going to teach you everything you need to know to be a professional software developer. 

The curriculum you'll encounter on Learn is rigorous. Expect it to be a more challenging than other online learning platforms. We don't dumb anything down for you because we believe in your infinite capacity to learn. While challenging, our curriculum is clear, digestible, engaging, and deep. There's going to be reading, videos, and lots of coding ahead. 

Remember, nothing in the world worth knowing comes easily and you should never get intimidated just because something is hard. Difficult is not impossible and one of the most valuable things you're going to learn about is your limitless ability to overcome challenges. Have patience, all things are foreign before they become familiar.

You're also going to have to learn how to work like a real developer, with real tools, things like a Command Line, Terminal, or Shell, an industrial strength (professional) text editor, and a complete development environment. We'll make the process as straightforward as we can, but we can't teach you to be a real programmer without using real tools.

Learn will demand that you be patient, resilient, resourceful, and gritty. Isn't that the kind of person you want to be? We think that's the kind of person you already are.

The good news is that when you hit a wall on Learn, there will be plenty of people around you to help. We simply don't believe in learning alone and built Learn around our robust community. As you make progress, expect to bump into other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed. 

When you're stuck, you can ask a question and get help from a global community of students and instructors. If there's a concept that's tricky to grasp, you can create a study group to review it with your peers, online or in-person. You'll read your classmates' blog posts and share your own perspective with them. Together we can go further than we could ever possibly go alone. 

We expect everyone on Learn to be friendly, respectful, helpful, and nice. Learn is special because of the people like you that make it that way.
